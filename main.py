I am writing to express my strong interest in the {position} position at your organization.

As a Senior Software Engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance, and secure web applications using React.js, TypeScript, Golang, and PostgreSQL.

At I-Exceed, I built robust React-based payment and billing modules, introduced OTP authentication with Twilio and Firebase, and developed Golang-based SNMP Telegraf plugins to process device logs‚Äîimproving monitoring and security compliance. My work consistently aligns with PCI-DSS and other enterprise-grade standards.

During my tenure at Infosys, I developed a full-stack Software Account Invitation Tool using React and Golang, successfully managing 1,000+ secure accounts and improving onboarding time by 35%.

In my personal projects, I‚Äôve implemented a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with full test coverage and integrated Swagger for API documentation. My animated Next.js portfolio and RBAC project are available on GitHub.

Please find my resume attached. I would be thrilled to contribute to your team and further elevate your digital platforms. Currenlty, I am serving notice period and my LWD is 20th September 2025.

Best regards,
