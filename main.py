I am writing to express my strong interest in the {position} position at your organization.

As a Senior Software Engineer with 3.5 years of experience, I specialize in developing scalable, high-performance, and secure applications using React.js, TypeScript, Golang, Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. My expertise spans frontend architecture, backend services, and database management, enabling me to deliver end-to-end solutions.

At I-Exceed Technology & Solution, I enhanced banking applications by optimizing React.js payment modules with pagination, lazy loading, and reusable UI components, reducing load times by 30%. I also built bill payment functionalities, integrated OTP authentication with Twilio and Firebase, and implemented JWT-based authentication with RBAC for improved security compliance. Additionally, I contributed to backend enhancements by fixing critical bugs and integrating APIs with Spring Boot.

Previously, at Infosys, I developed a full-stack Software Account Invitation Tool using React.js and TypeScript, which streamlined the management of 1,000+ secure accounts and reduced onboarding time by 35%. I also engineered custom SNMP Telegraf plugins in Golang to capture and process device logs, significantly improving monitoring accuracy.

Beyond professional work, I‚Äôve built a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) project with comprehensive unit and integration testing and integrated Swagger UI for seamless API documentation. I also maintain a Next.js portfolio showcasing responsive design and modern frontend practices.

I am currently serving my notice period, with my last working day on 30th September 2025. I am eager to bring my expertise in full-stack development and secure application design to your team and contribute to building innovative, high-quality digital solutions.

Please find my resume attached for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills can add value to your organization.

Best regards,
