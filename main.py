I am writing to express my interest in the {position} role. With over 3+ years of experience in frontend development using React.js, TypeScript, and Next.js, I specialize in building responsive, secure, scalable and high-performance web apps for enterprise and product-based applications.

At I-Exceed Technology, I developed pagination and payment modules for banking systems, optimized performance using React Hooks, and implemented OTP-based authentication integrated with services like Twilio and Firebase. My work resulted in faster transaction speeds and enhanced security, aligning with PCI-DSS standards.

Previously at Infosys, I built a Software Account Invitation Tool managing over 1,000 secure accounts. I applied TDD principles using Jest, implemented role-based access with JWT, and created dynamic dashboards with styled-components, which improved onboarding efficiency by 35%.

In addition to professional experience, Iâ€™ve developed personal projects including a Next.js-based animated portfolio and a full-stack job portal with AWS deployment and user authentication.

My current CTC is â‚¹7.11 LPA, and I am currently serving a 30-day notice period. I am enthusiastic about joining a forward-thinking team where I can contribute my frontend expertise and continue to grow.

Please find my resume attached. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
